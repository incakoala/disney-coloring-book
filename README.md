## Welcome to Wish Upon a Star!
Wish Upon a Star is a web page where users can choose a picture on the site and color it away with the colors of their choice. This is a place for users from any age to relax and express their imagination and creativity through beloved Disney characters. As Disney fans, our team came up with the idea for this website because we wanted to apply the materials learned in class, while creating something that is unique and enjoyable for users and most importantly ourselves!

The website features a fun, eye-catching UI, with functionalities that are intuitive to be used by users from any age. For future iterations, we hope to add the option for guest users to add their colorings, as well as improve the user flow even further after we've collected enough beta feedbacks.
